  abstract = {The Burnett equations is a superset of the Navier--Stokes equations, and one of the most important higher-order continuum transport equations. The derivation and nature of the equation in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is presented in this chapter. The equations involve large number of terms, which makes them quite formidable to solve, both analytically and numerically. Nonetheless there has been some recent success in obtaining analytical solution of the Burnett equations, as discussed here. An order of magnitude analysis of the various terms reveals that the Burnett-order terms in the equations are of order Knudsen number square. A stability analysis of the equations for one-dimensional wave reveals the unstable nature of the equations.},

The focus is on facilities capable of producing real-gas effects (dissociation, ionization, and thermochemical nonequilibrium) pertinent to the study of atmospheric flight in the Mach number range of 5 {$<$} M {$<$} 50. Perceived mission needs of interest to the Americans and Western Europeans are described where such real-gas flows are important.  The role of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in modern ground testing is discussed, and the capabilities of selected American and European real-gas facilities are described. An update on the current instrumentation in aerothermodynamic testing is also outlined.  Comments are made regarding the use of new facilities which have been brought on line during the past 3-5 years. Finally, future needs for aerothermodynamic testing, including instrumentation, are discussed and recommendations for implementation are reported.},

  abstract = {The flamelet approach for non-premixed combustion is based on the description of the turbulent flame as a collection of laminar flame elements embedded in a turbulent flow and interacting with it. The local structure of the flame at each point of the flame front is supposed to be similar to a laminar flamelet, while the interaction with turbulence is reduced to the front evolution. This view is supported by the introduction of the mixture fraction, which allows to decouple the turbulent transport and the flame structure. One key parameter of the flamelet structure is the scalar dissipation rate, which controls the reactant fluxes to the reaction zone and is related to the flow velocity gradients. Probability density functions or flame surface density are then used to describe the turbulent flame and relate the flamelet description to the turbulent flame front. As unsteady effects may become significant, various transient flamelet approaches also exist to take into account the flame history. The flamelet approach may be used either in the RANS or LES context and is still being developed to account for additional complexities such as heat losses and sprays.},

A Galerkin approximation for realistic boundary conditions that describes stationary and oscillatory convection in the form of straight parallel rolls is used to determine the influence of the Dufour effect on the bifurcation behavior of convective flow intensity, vertical heat current, and concentration mixing. The Dufour-induced changes in the bifurcation topology and the existence regimes of stationary and traveling-wave convection are elucidated. To check the validity of the Galerkin results we compare them with finite-difference numerical simulations of the full hydrodynamical field equations. Furthermore, we report on the scaling behavior of linear properties of the stationary instability.},

Two cases are treated: (1) the lighter parent gas is initially in rigid body rotation, (2) it is initially at rest under a strong body force. Under isothermal condition, baro-diffusion effect is the only physical factor causing separation of the two species. For small concentration of the heavy gas, the equation governing the diffusional process is decoupled from the flow equations. The resulting initial-boundary value problems are solved by eigenfunction expansions. Of special interest is the result that baro-diffusion effect reduces the time for the establishment of equilibrium profile for arbitrary nonuniform initial concentration distribution as compared to the time for ordinary mass diffusion.},

The L-S technique eliminates the two transverse coordinates and converts the detailed models expressed in terms of three spatial coordinates and time to multi-mode models in axial coordinate and time. The reduced order models are expressed in terms of phase averaged multiple concentration (temperature) modes and interfacial fluxes which are related through various transfer coefficients that are local scale, flow and property dependent. Accurate expressions are provided for estimating the local transfer coefficient matrices for multi-component systems. Various limiting cases of the multi-mode reduced order models are discussed and compared to other models in the literature. The usefulness of the reduced order models is illustrated by two examples: the first is the oxidative coupling of methane in a laboratory scale monolith reactor, the second is the determination of the ignition-extinction behavior of catalytically assisted combustion of propane. Other possible applications and extensions are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The momentum and heat transport in rarefied gas flows is known to deviate from the classical laws of Navier and Fourier in Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. A more sophisticated Nonlinear Coupled Constitutive Model (NCCM) has been derived from the Boltzmann equation to describe gaseous and thermal transport both in continuum and rarefied gas flows. We first develop a unified numerical framework for modeling continuum and rarefied flows based on the NCCM model both in two and three dimensions. Special treatment is given to the complex highly nonlinear transport equations for non-conserved variables that arise from the high degree of thermal nonequilibrium. For verification and validation, we apply the present scheme to a stiff problem of hypersonic gas flows around a 2D cylinder, a 3D sphere, and the Apollo configuration both in continuum and rarefied situations. The results show that the present unified framework yields solutions that are in better agreement with the benchmark and experimental data than are the NSF results in all studied cases of rarefied problems. Good agreement is observed between the present study and the NSF results for continuum cases. The results show that this study provides a unified framework for modeling continuum and rarefied gas flows.},
